# Python Air Hockey 🏒

This is a simple game in Python, developed during my Programming classes in the 10th grade as a project to assess students' knowledge of Python.

## Game Overview

- **1v1 Gameplay**: Two players can compete against each other on the same keyboard.
  - Player 1 uses the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to control their character.
  - Player 2 uses the arrow keys (`←`, `↑`, `→`, `↓`) to control their character.
- **Score Counter**: The game includes a score-tracking feature to determine the winner.

## How to Play 🎮

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the game using the following command:
   ```bash
   python game.py
   ```
4. Enjoy playing with a friend! 👥

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Known Issues and Limitations ❌

- **No Barriers**: Players can traverse through the visual boundaries of the field, which may disrupt the gameplay experience.
- **Lack of Physics for the Disc**: The disc moves erratically and lacks proper direction and control, affecting game dynamics.
- **Game Never Ends**: The game does not have a defined endpoint or win condition, requiring players to manually stop when desired.
